# Description

This is the web app of HODL. HODL is a solution for ERC20 tokens protocols that want to create a vault where fees/earnings of the ERC20 token protocol are stored and where holders of the token can donate and redeem a part of protocol's earnings for burning the initial protocol token, assuring an argbitrage opportunity and sustain the token price in a long term.

Right now it's in archived version, and the API is not working so the app basically just a demo with some dummy data from Sepolia ETH testnet for informational purposes. The demo is deployed at https://hodl-industries.web.app/
